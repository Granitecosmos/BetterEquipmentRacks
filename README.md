# Better Equipment Racks
Have you ever wondered why the hell do Equipment Racks have quality? Have you ever wanted to make a nice drug cabinet in your hospital?

Well fear not, for I bring you Better Equipment Racks!

Let me tell you the difference between an Awful Wooden Equipment Rack and a Legendary Wooden Equipment Rack. The latter has more that TEN times the market value! That's it, no other difference!

This is UNACCEPTABLE!

Sure, it can be used to increase the wealth of a room but wait, what's this? Sculptures exist too and they do that better? That's right, so why the hell do these things have a quality again?

Time to fix this! Since most stuff that can be placed on Equipment Racks now have a negative beauty value, let's give a beauty value to this piece of furniture. Problem solved, now there's one stat that scales with quality. Yay!

But wait, what's this? Want to shove that nice Marble Equipment Rack into the hospital so you can have an aesthetic drug cabinet? Nope, you can't store that there. OR CAN YOU? From now on, everything that's under the categories "Items" and "Manufactured" can be stored there. Easy fix, easy life.
