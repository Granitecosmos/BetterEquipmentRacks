# Better Equipment Racks (no, I'm not gonna change it to "Better Shelves")
Have you ever wondered why the hell do ~~Equipment Racks~~ Shelves have quality? ~~Have you ever wanted to make a nice medicine cabinet in your hospital?~~ Yeah, already vanilla, thanks to yours truly!

**Well fear not, for I bring you Better Equipment Racks!**

Let me tell you the difference between an Awful Wooden ~~Equipment Rack~~ Shelf and a Legendary Wooden ~~Equipment Rack~~ Shelf. The latter has more that TEN times the market value! That's it, no other difference!

***This is UNACCEPTABLE!***

Sure, it can be used to increase the wealth of a room but wait, what's this? Sculptures exist too and they do that better? That's right, so why the hell do these things have a quality again?

Time to fix this! Since most stuff that can be placed on ~~Equipment Racks~~ Shelves now have a negative beauty value, let's give a beauty value to this piece of furniture. Problem solved, now there's one stat that scales with quality. Yay!

***But wait, there's more!***

Thanks to yours truly posting in the "Mods you'd like to see in vanilla" thread, the original, most important function of storing almost everything on the Shelf is vanilla functionality as of A17. Yup, my mod has permanently contributed to RimWorld!

# Balance
People might actually start using this furniture now. Another source of beauty, another useful addition. Also, remember that items stored in ~~Equipment Racks~~ Shelves don't deteriorate.

# Compatibility
As of A17, this mod should totally be fine with any other unless they add beauty to the Shelf.
